# Hi there, I'm Pedro Ferreira! 👋

I’m a Senior Image Processing and Data Scientist, currently collaborating with physicists, clinicians, and industry partners on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) research. My work bridges data analysis, image processing, and deep learning, with a focus on advancing in vivo imaging and creating compelling visual representations of complex data.

Outside of work, I’m a proud dad and an enthusiastic amateur photographer. I’m currently based in the UK.

[Publication link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.28294) (Python, TensorFlow).

### Private

- In vivo diffusion tensor prediction with convolutional neural networks: promising approach to minimise the amount of data required in clinical DT-CMR studies. Publication 1 and 2 (Python, TensorFlow, Pytorch).
- Automatic batch-processing of large histology images, including image registration and extracting the main direction of muscle cells. (MATLAB + Python).
- In-line post-processing in real-time using the Open Recon platform, providing the operator with DT-CMR results and feedback on scan success/failure during scan acquisition, leading to improved quality and efficiency. (Python, TensorFlow).
