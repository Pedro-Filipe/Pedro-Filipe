# Hi there, I'm Pedro Ferreira! 👋

I’m a Senior Image Processing and Data Scientist, currently collaborating with physicists, clinicians, and industry partners on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) research. My work bridges data analysis, image processing, and deep learning, with a focus on advancing in vivo imaging and creating compelling visual representations of complex data.

Outside of work, I’m a proud dad and an enthusiastic amateur photographer. I’m currently based in the UK.
